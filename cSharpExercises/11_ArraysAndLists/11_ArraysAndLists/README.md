# Arrays, ArrayLists, and Lists Challenge
1. Create an AverageOfValues() method that returns the average value of a passed in int array.

2. Create a SunIsShining() method, which has a parameter of int[] as its parameter. 
    - This method increases each array element by 2 and returns an array with the altered values.

3. ArrayList() : Add 'using System.Collections;' to Program.cs
    - Create a ArrayListAvg() method that has an ArrayList as parameter and returns a double.
    - Create an ArrayList in Main with at least 6 values and at least one of each of int, double, and string to send to the method.
    - The methodreturns the average value calculated from the int's and doubles.
    - You will have to check for int, double, or string in the ArrayList.
    - To get the average of all of the numbers (int and double) will require casting.

4. List<> :
    - Create a ListAscendingOrder() method with two parameters List<int> and int. The method will return an int, the place in ascending order where the number is found after inserting it into the List<int>.

5. List<>: 
    - Create a FindStringInList() method with two parameters
        - List<string>
        - string
    - The method will return true if the string parameter is found in the List, otherwise false.
