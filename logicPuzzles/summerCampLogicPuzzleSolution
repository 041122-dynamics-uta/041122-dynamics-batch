The Long and Short of It:
We know Zina is taller than Weldon and Weldon is taller than Delia, which gives us an initial heirarchy of Zina > Weldon > Delia
Since we know Leisha is taller than Benito, (Leisha>Benito) and shorter than Delia and Weldon, and no one is taller than Zina
That would place ther heirarchy at Zina > Weldon > Delia > Leisha > Benito
And since Charlotte is not mentioned and it is specified that Benito is not the shortest, we can assume that
Charlotte is the shortest because otherwise Benito would be shortest on the heirarchy, which is be false.
Zina > Weldon > Delia > Leisha > Benito > Charlotte
